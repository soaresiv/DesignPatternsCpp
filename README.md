## Design Patterns in Modern C++

This repo contains code snippings of [**Design Patterns in Modern C++**](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/) course from [Dmitri Nesteruk](https://twitter.com/dnesteruk)

## How to build

It's recommended to create an empty subfolder inside the source directory as build directory.

```bash
cmake -B <build_dir_different_from_source_dir> -S <source_dir>
cd build_dir_different_from_source_dir
make VERBOSE=1
```
